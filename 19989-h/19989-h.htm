<h2>I</h2><h3>Story-Tell Lib</h3>
</div>

<p>That was what everybody in the little mountain village called her.
Her real name, as she often told me, ringing out each syllable proudly
in her shrill sweet voice, was Elizabeth Rowena Marietta York. A
stately name, indeed, for the little crippled, stunted, helpless
creature, and I myself could never think of her by any name but the
one the village people used, Story-tell Lib. I had heard of her for
two or three summers in my visits to Greenhills. The village folk had
talked to me of the little lame girl who told such pretty stories out
of her own head, &#8220;kind o&#8217; fables that learnt folks things, and helped
&#8217;em without bein&#8217; too preachy.&#8221; But I<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span> had no definite idea of what
the child was till I saw and heard her myself. She was about thirteen
years of age, but very small and fragile. She was lame, and could walk
only with the aid of a crutch. Indeed, she could but hobble painfully,
a few steps at a time, with that assistance. Her little white face was
not an attractive one, her features being sharp and pinched, and her
eyes faded, dull, and almost expressionless. Only the full, prominent,
rounding brow spoke of a mind out of the common. She was an orphan,
and lived with her aunt, Miss Jane York, in an old-fashioned farmhouse
on the upper road.</p>

<p>Miss Jane was a good woman. She kept the child neatly clothed and
comfortably fed, but I do not think she lavished many caresses or
loving words on little Lib, it was not her way, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span> girl led a
lonesome, quiet, unchildlike life. Aunt Jane tried to teach her to
read and write, but, whether from the teacher&#8217;s inability to impart
knowledge, or from some strange lack in the child&#8217;s odd brain, Lib
never learned the lesson. She could not read a word, she did not even
know her alphabet. I cannot explain to myself or to you the one gift
which gave her her homely village name. She told stories. I listened
to many of them, and I took down from her lips several of these. They
are, as you will see if you read them, &#8220;kind o&#8217; fables,&#8221; as the
country folk said. They were all simple little tales in the dialect of
the hill country in which she lived. But each held some lesson,
suggested some truth, which, strangely enough, the child herself did
not seem to see; at least, she never admitted that she saw or intended
any hidden meaning.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span></p>

<p>I often questioned her as to this after we became friends. After
listening to some tale in which I could discern just the lovely truth
which would best help some troubled soul in her audience, I have
questioned her as to its meaning. I can see now, in memory, the short-sighted, expressionless eyes of faded blue which met mine as she said,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t mean anything,&mdash;it don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s jest a story. Stories don&#8217;t
have to mean things; they&#8217;re stories, and I tells &#8217;em.&#8221; That was all
she would say, and the mystery remained. What did it mean? Whence came
that strange power of giving to the people who came to her something
to help and cheer, both help and cheer hidden in a simple little
story? Was it, as I like to think, God-given, a treasure sent from
above? Or would you rather think it an inheritance from some
ancestor,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span> a writer, a teller of tales? Or perhaps you
believe in the transmigration of souls, and think that the spirit of
some &AElig;sop of old, who spoke in parables, had entered the frail
crippled body of our little Lib, and spoke through her pinched pale
lips. I leave you your theories, I keep my own.</p>

<p>But one thing which I find I have omitted thus far may seem to you
to throw a little light on this matter. It does not help me much. Lib
was a wonderful listener, as well as a narrator. Miss Jane sometimes
took an occasional boarder. Teachers, clergymen, learned professors,
had from time to time tarried under her roof. And while these talked
to one another, or to some visitor from neighboring hotels, little Lib
would sit motionless and silent by the hour. One would scarcely call
it listening; to listen seems too active a<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span> verb in this case. The girl&#8217;s
face wore no eager look of interest, the faded, short-sighted eyes did
not light up with intelligence, nor the features quiver with varied
emotions. If she received ideas from what fell upon her ears, it must
have been by a sort of unconscious absorption. She took it in as the
earth does the rain or the flower the sunshine. And so it was with any
reading aloud from book or paper. She would sit, utterly quiet, while
the reader&#8217;s voice went on, and nothing could draw her away till it
was ended. Question her later as to what was read or spoken of, and
you gained no satisfaction. If she had any idea of what she had heard,
she had not the power of putting it into words. &#8220;I like it. I like it
lots,&#8221; she would say; that was all.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole summer in which I knew the child, the
summer<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
which came so quickly, so sadly, to an end, little Lib sat, on bright,
fair days, in a low wooden chair under the maples in front of the
farmhouse. And it had grown to be the custom of her many friends, both
young and old, to gather there, and listen to her stories, if she had
any to tell. I often joined the group of listeners. On many, many
days, as the season advanced, Lib had no words for us. She had always
been a fragile, puny little creature, and this year she seemed to grow
weaker, thinner, more waxen white, each day. She had a wonderful
voice, shrill, far-reaching, but strangely sweet and clear, with a
certain vibrating, reedy, bird-like quality, which even yet thrills me
as I recall it.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you a few of the little stories, pictures,
fables, parables, allegories,&mdash;I scarcely know what to<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span> call
them,&mdash;which I heard Story-tell Lib relate. The words are her
own, but I cannot give you the sweet tones, the quaint manner, the
weird, strange personality, of the little narrator. Let me say here
that often the little parables seemed meant to cheer and lift up Lib&#8217;s
own trembling soul, shut up in the frail, crippled body. Meant, I say;
perhaps that is not the right word. For did she mean anything by these
tales, at least consciously? Be that as it may, certain of these
little stories seemed to touch her own case strangely.</p>

<h2>The Shet-up Posy</h2><h3>II</h3>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>The first story I ever heard the child tell
was one of those which seemed to hold comfort and cheer for herself or
for humble little souls like her. It was a story of the closed
gentian, the title of which she announced, as she always did, loudly,
and with an amusing little air of self-satisfaction.</p>

<h3>The Shet-up Posy</h3>

<p>Once there was a posy. &#8217;T wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a common kind o&#8217; posy, that blows
out wide open, so&#8217;s everybody can see its outsides and its insides
too. But &#8217;t was one of them posies like what grows down the road, back
o&#8217; your pa&#8217;s sugar-house, Danny, and don&#8217;t come till way towards fall.
They&#8217;re sort o&#8217; blue, but<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span> real dark, and they look &#8217;s if they was
buds &#8217;stead o&#8217; posies,&mdash;only buds opens out, and these doesn&#8217;t
They&#8217;re all shet up close and tight, and they never, never, never
opens. Never mind how much sun they get, never mind how much rain or
how much drouth, whether it&#8217;s cold or hot, them posies stay shet up
tight, kind o&#8217; buddy, and not finished and humly. But if you pick &#8217;em
open, real careful, with a pin,&mdash;I&#8217;ve done it,&mdash;you find
they&#8217;re dreadful pretty inside.</p>

<p>You couldn&#8217;t see a posy that was finished off better, soft and
nice, with pretty little stripes painted on &#8217;em, and all the little
things like threads in the middle, sech as the open posies has,
standing up, with little knots on their tops, oh, so pretty,&mdash;you
never did! Makes you think real hard, that does; leastways, makes me.
What&#8217;s they<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span> that way for? If they ain&#8217;t never goin&#8217; to
open out, what&#8217;s the use o&#8217; havin&#8217; the shet-up part so slicked up and
nice, with nobody never seem&#8217; it? Folks has different names for &#8217;em,
dumb foxgloves, blind genshuns, and all that, but I allers call &#8217;em
the shet-up posies.</p>

<p>Well, &#8217;t was one o&#8217; that kind o&#8217; posy I was goin&#8217; to tell you
about. &#8217;Twas one o&#8217; the shet-uppest and the buddiest of all on &#8217;em,
all blacky-blue and straight up and down, and shet up fast and tight.
Nobody&#8217;d ever dream&#8217;t was pretty inside. And the funniest thing, it
didn&#8217;t know &#8217;twas so itself! It thought &#8217;twas a mistake somehow,
thought it had oughter been a posy, and was begun for one, but wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
finished, and &#8217;twas terr&#8217;ble unhappy. It knew there was pretty posies
all &#8217;round there, goldenrod and purple daisies and all; and their
inside was the right side,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span> and they was proud of it, and held it open,
and showed the pretty lining, all soft and nice with the little fuzzy
yeller threads standin&#8217; up, with little balls on their tip ends. And
the shet-up posy felt real bad; not mean and hateful and begrudgin&#8217;,
you know, and wantin&#8217; to take away the nice part from the other
posies, but sorry, and kind o&#8217; &#8217;shamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, deary me!&#8221; she says,&mdash;I most forgot to say &#8217;twas a girl
posy,&mdash;&#8220;deary me, what a humly, skimpy, awk&#8217;ard thing I be! I
ain&#8217;t more &#8217;n half made; there ain&#8217;t no nice, pretty lining inside o&#8217;
me, like them other posies; and on&#8217;y my wrong side shows, and that&#8217;s
jest plain and common. I can&#8217;t chirk up folks like the goldenrod and
daisies does. Nobody won&#8217;t want to pick me and carry me home. I ain&#8217;t
no good to anybody, and I never shall be.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span></p>

<p>So she kep&#8217; on, thinkin&#8217; these dreadful sorry thinkin&#8217;s, and most
wishin&#8217; she&#8217;d never been made at all. You know &#8217;t wa&#8217;n&#8217;t jest at fust
she felt this way. Fust she thought she was a bud, like lots o&#8217; buds
all &#8217;round her, and she lotted on openin&#8217; like they did. But when the
days kep&#8217; passin&#8217; by, and all the other buds opened out, and showed
how pretty they was, and she didn&#8217;t open, why, then she got terr&#8217;ble
discouraged; and I don&#8217;t wonder a mite.</p>

<p>She&#8217;d see the dew a-layin&#8217; soft and cool on the other posies&#8217;
faces, and the sun a-shinin&#8217; warm on &#8217;em as they held &#8217;em up, and
sometimes she&#8217;d see a butterfly come down and light on &#8217;em real soft,
and kind o&#8217; put his head down to &#8217;em, &#8217;s if he was kissin&#8217; &#8217;em, and
she thought &#8217;twould be powerful nice to hold her face up to all them
pleasant things. But she couldn&#8217;t.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span></p>

<p>But one day, afore she&#8217;d got very old, &#8217;fore she&#8217;d dried up or fell
off, or anything like that, she see somebody comin&#8217; along her way.
&#8217;Twas a man, and he was lookin&#8217; at all the posies real hard and
partic&#8217;lar, but he wasn&#8217;t pickin&#8217; any of &#8217;em. Seems &#8217;s if he was
lookin&#8217; for somethin&#8217; diff&#8217;rent from what he see, and the poor little
shet-up posy begun to wonder what he was arter. Bimeby she braced up,
and she asked him about it in her shet-up, whisp&#8217;rin&#8217; voice. And says
he, the man says: &#8220;I&#8217;m a-pickin&#8217; posies. That&#8217;s what I work at most o&#8217;
the time. &#8217;T ain&#8217;t for myself,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but the one I work for. I&#8217;m
on&#8217;y his help. I run errands and do chores for him, and it&#8217;s a
partic&#8217;lar kind o&#8217; posy he&#8217;s sent me for to-day.&#8221; &#8220;What for does he
want &#8217;em?&#8221; says the shet-up posy. &#8220;Why, to set out in his<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span> gardin,&#8221;
the man says. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the beautif&#8217;lest gardin you never see, and I
pick posies for &#8217;t.&#8221; &#8220;Deary me,&#8221; thinks she to herself, &#8220;I jest wish
he&#8217;d pick me. But I ain&#8217;t the kind, I know.&#8221; And then she says, so
soft he can&#8217;t hardly hear her, &#8220;What sort o&#8217; posies is it you&#8217;re arter
this time?&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; says the man, &#8220;it&#8217;s a dreadful sing&#8217;lar order I&#8217;ve
got to-day. I got to find a posy that&#8217;s handsomer inside than &#8217;t is
outside, one that folks ain&#8217;t took no notice of here, &#8217;cause &#8217;twas
kind o&#8217; humly and queer to look at, not knowin&#8217; that inside &#8217;twas as
handsome as any posy on the airth. Seen any o&#8217; that kind?&#8221; says the
man.</p>

<p>Well, the shet-up posy was dreadful worked up. &#8220;Deary dear!&#8221; she
says to herself, &#8220;now if they&#8217;d on&#8217;y finished me off inside! I&#8217;m the
right kind outside, humly and queer enough, but<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span> there&#8217;s
nothin&#8217; worth lookin&#8217; at inside,&mdash;I&#8217;m certin sure o&#8217; that.&#8221; But
she didn&#8217;t say this nor anything else out loud, and bimeby, when the
man had waited, and didn&#8217;t get any answer, he begun to look at the
shet-up posy more partic&#8217;lar, to see why she was so mum. And all of a
suddent he says, the man did, &#8220;Looks to me&#8217;s if you was somethin&#8217; that
kind yourself, ain&#8217;t ye?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no, no, no!&#8221; whispers the shet-up posy.
&#8220;I wish I was, I wish I was. I&#8217;m all right outside, humly and awk&#8217;ard,
queer&#8217;s I can be, but I ain&#8217;t pretty inside,&mdash;oh! I most know I
ain&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8220;I ain&#8217;t so sure o&#8217; that myself,&#8221; says the man, &#8220;but I can
tell in a jiffy.&#8221; &#8220;Will you have to pick me to pieces?&#8221; says the shet-up posy. &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; says the man; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a way o&#8217; tellin&#8217;, the
one I work for showed me.&#8221; The shet-up posy never knowed what<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span> he done
to her. I don&#8217;t know myself, but &#8217;twas somethin&#8217; soft and pleasant,
that didn&#8217;t hurt a mite, and then the man he says, &#8220;Well, well, well!&#8221;
That&#8217;s all he said, but he took her up real gentle, and begun to carry
her away. &#8220;Where be ye takin&#8217; me?&#8221; says the shet-up posy. &#8220;Where ye
belong,&#8221; says the man; &#8220;to the gardin o&#8217; the one I work for,&#8221; he says.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was nice enough inside,&#8221; says the shet-up posy, very
soft and still. &#8220;They most gen&#8217;ally don&#8217;t,&#8221; says the man.</p>

Among those who sometimes came to listen to little Lib&#8217;s allegories
was Mary Ann Sherman, a tall, dark, gloomy woman of whom I had heard
much. She was the daughter of old Deacon Sherman, a native of the
village, who had, some years before I came to Greenhills, died by his
own hand, after suffering many years from a sort of religious
melancholia. Whether the trouble was hereditary and his daughter was
born with a tendency inherited from her father, or whether she was
influenced by what she had heard of his life, and death, I do not
know. But she was a dreary creature with never a smile or a hopeful
look upon her dark<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span> face. Nothing to her was right or good;
this world was a desert, her friends had all left her, strangers
looked coldly upon her. As for the future, there was nothing to look
forward to in this world or the next. As Dave Moony, the village
cynic, said, &#8220;Mary Ann wa&#8217;n&#8217;t proud or set up about nothin&#8217; but bein&#8217;
the darter of a man that had c&#8217;mitted the onpar&#8217;nable sin.&#8221; Poor
woman! her eyes were blinded to all the beauty and brightness of this
world, to the hope and love and joy of the next. What wonder that one
day, as she paused in passing the little group gathered around Lib,
and the child began the little story I give below, I thought it well
fitted to the gloomy woman&#8217;s case!<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span></p>

<h3>The Horse that B&#8217;leeved he&#8217;d Get there</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve seen them thrashin&#8217; machines they&#8217;re usin&#8217; round here. The
sort, you know, where the horses keep steppin&#8217; up a board thing &#8217;s if
they was climbin&#8217; up-hill or goin&#8217; up a pair o&#8217; stairs, only they
don&#8217;t never get along a mite; they keep right in the same place all
the time, steppin&#8217; and steppin&#8217;, but never gittin&#8217; on.</p>

<p>Well, I knew a horse once, that worked on one o&#8217; them things. His
name was Jack, and he was a nice horse. First time they put him on to
thrash, he didn&#8217;t know what the machine was, and he walked along and
up the boards quick and lively, and he didn&#8217;t see why he didn&#8217;t get on
faster. There was a horse side of him named Billy, a<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span> kind o&#8217;
frettin&#8217;, cross feller, and he see through it right off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go along,&#8221; he says to Jack; &#8220;&#8217;t ain&#8217;t no use; you won&#8217;t
never get on, they&#8217;re foolin&#8217; us, and I won&#8217;t give in to &#8217;em.&#8221; So
Billy he hung back and shook his head, and tried to get away, and to
kick, and the man whipped him, and hollered at him. But Jack, he went
on quiet and quick and pleasant, steppin&#8217; away, and he says softly to
Billy, &#8220;Come along,&#8221; he says; &#8220;it&#8217;s all right, we&#8217;ll be there bimeby.
Don&#8217;t you see how I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; on a&#8217;ready?&#8221; And that was the ways
things went every day.</p>

<p>Jack never gin up; he climbed and climbed, and walked and walked,
jest&#8217;s if he see the place he was goin&#8217; to, and &#8217;s if it got nearer
and nearer. And every night, when they took him off, he was as pleased
with his day&#8217;s journey<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span> &#8217;s if he&#8217;d gone twenty mile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done
first-rate to-day,&#8221; he says to cross, kickin&#8217; Billy. &#8220;The roads was
good, and I never picked up a stone nor dropped a shoe, and I got on a
long piece. I&#8217;ll be there pretty soon,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Why,&#8221; says Billy,
&#8220;what a foolish fellow you be! You&#8217;ve been in the same place all day,
and ain&#8217;t got on one mite. What do you mean by <i>there</i>? Where is
it you think you&#8217;re goin&#8217;, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t &#8217;zackly know,&#8221; says Jack, &#8220;but I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; there
real spry. I &#8217;most see it one time to-day.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t mind Billy&#8217;s
laughin&#8217; at him, and tryin&#8217; to keep him from bein&#8217; sat&#8217;sfied. He jest
went on tryin&#8217; and tryin&#8217; to get there, and hopin&#8217; and believin&#8217; he
would after a spell. He was always peart and comfortable, took his
work real easy, relished his victuals and drink, and slept first rate
nights. But Billy he fretted<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span> and scolded and kicked and bit, and that
made him hot and tired, and got him whipped, and hollered at, and
pulled, and yanked. You see, he hadn&#8217;t got anything in his mind to
chirk him up, for he didn&#8217;t believe anything good was comin&#8217;, as Jack
did; he &#8217;most knowed it wasn&#8217;t, but Jack &#8217;most knowed it was. And Jack
took notice of things that Billy never see at all. He see the trees a-growin&#8217;, and heered the birds a-singin&#8217;, and Injun Brook a-gugglin&#8217;
along over the stones, and he watched the butterflies a-flyin&#8217;, and
sometimes a big yeller &#8217;n black one would light right on his back.
Jack took notice of &#8217;em all, and he&#8217;d say, &#8220;I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; along now,
certin sure, for there&#8217;s birds and posies and flyin&#8217; things here I
never see back along. I guess I&#8217;m most there.&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;There, there!&#8217;&#8221;
Billy&#8217;d say. &#8220;Where is it,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span> anyway? I ain&#8217;t never seen any o&#8217; them
posies and creaturs you talk about, and I&#8217;m right side of you on these
old boards the whole time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all the children round there liked Jack. They&#8217;d watch the two
horses workin&#8217;, and they see Billy all cross and skittish, holdin&#8217;
back and shakin&#8217; his head and tryin&#8217; to kick, never takin&#8217; no notice
o&#8217; them nor anything. And, again, they see Jack steppin&#8217; along peart
and spry, pleasant and willin&#8217;, turnin&#8217; his head when they come up to
him, and lookin&#8217; friendly at &#8217;em out of his kind brown eyes, and
they&#8217;d say, the boys and girls would, &#8220;Good Jack! nice old Jack!&#8221; and
they&#8217;d pat him, and give him an apple, or a carrot, or suthin&#8217; good.
But they didn&#8217;t give Billy any. They didn&#8217;t like his ways, and they
was &#8217;most afraid he&#8217;d bite their fingers. And<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span> Jack would say, come
evenin&#8217;, &#8220;It&#8217;s gittin&#8217; nicer and nicer we get further on the
road,&mdash;ain&#8217;t it? Folks is pleasanter speakin&#8217;, and the victuals
&#8217;pears better flavored, and things is comfortabler every way, seems &#8217;s
if, and I jedge by that we&#8217;re &#8217;most there.&#8221; But Billy&#8217;d say, a-grumblin&#8217; away, &#8220;It&#8217;s worse&#8217;n worse,&mdash;young ones a-botherin&#8217; my
life out o&#8217; me, and the birds a-jabberin&#8217; and the posies a-smellin&#8217;
till my head aches. Oh, deary me! I&#8217;m &#8217;most dead.&#8221; So &#8217;t went on and
kep&#8217; on. Jack had every mite as hard work as Billy, but he didn&#8217;t mind
it, he was so full o&#8217; what was comin&#8217; and how good &#8217;t would be to get
there. And &#8217;cause he was pleasant and willin&#8217; and worked so good, and
&#8217;cause he took notice o&#8217; all the nice things round him, and see new
ones every day, he was treated real kind, and never got tired<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span> and used
up and low in his mind like Billy. Even the flies didn&#8217;t pester him&#8217;s
they done Billy, for he on&#8217;y said, when he felt &#8217;em bitin&#8217; and
crawlin&#8217;, &#8220;Dog-days is come,&#8221; says he, &#8220;for here&#8217;s the flies worse and
worse. So the summer&#8217;s most over, and I&#8217;ll get there in a jiffy
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I stoppin&#8217; for,&#8221; do you say, &#8216;Miry? &#8217;Cause that&#8217;s all. You
needn&#8217;t make sech a fuss, child&#8217;en. It&#8217;s done, this story is, I tell
ye. Leastways I don&#8217;t know any more on it. I told you all about them
two horses, and which had a good time and which didn&#8217;t, and what &#8217;twas
made the differ&#8217;nce &#8217;twixt &#8217;em. But you want to know whether Jack got
there. Well, I don&#8217;t know no more &#8217;n the horses did what <i>there</i>
was, but in my own mind I b&#8217;leeve he got it. Mebbe &#8217;t was jest dyin&#8217;
peaceful and quiet, and restin&#8217; after all that steppin&#8217;<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span> and
climbin&#8217;. He&#8217;d a-liked that, partic&#8217;lar when he knowed the folks was
sorry to have him go, and would allus rec&#8217;lect him. Mebbe &#8217;t was jest
livin&#8217; on and on, int&#8217;rested and enjoyin&#8217;, and liked by folks, and
then bein&#8217; took away from the hard work and put out to pastur&#8217; for the
rest o&#8217; his days. Mebbe &#8217;twas&mdash;Oh! I d&#8217;know. Might &#8217;a&#8217; been lots
o&#8217; things, but I feel pretty certin sure he got it, and he was glad he
hadn&#8217;t gi&#8217;n up b&#8217;leevin&#8217; &#8217;t would come. For you &#8217;member, all the time
when Billy &#8217;most knowed it wasn&#8217;t, Jack &#8217;most knowed &#8217;twas.</p>

<h2>The Plant that Lost its Berry</h2><h3>IV</h3>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>It was a sad day in Greenhills when we knew
that Susan Holcomb&#8217;s little Jerusha was dead. We all loved the child,
and she was her mother&#8217;s dearest treasure. Susan was a widow, and this
was her only child. A pretty little creature she was, with yellow
curls and dark-blue eyes, rosy and plump and sturdy. But a sudden,
sharp attack of croup seized the child, and in a few hours she fell
asleep. I need not tell you of the mother&#8217;s grief. She could not be
comforted because her child was not. One day a little neighbor, a boy
with great faith&mdash;not wholly misplaced&mdash;in the helpfulness
of Story-tell Lib&#8217;s little parables, succeeded, with a child&#8217;s art, in
bringing the sad mother to the<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span> group of listeners. And it was that day
that Lib told this new story.</p>

<h3><a name='The_Plant_that_Lost_its_Berry'
id='The_Plant_that_Lost_its_Berry'></a>The Plant that Lost its Berry</h3>

<p>Once there was a plant, and it had jest one little berry. And the
berry was real pretty to look at. It was sort o&#8217; blue, with a kind o&#8217;
whitey, foggy look all over the blue, and it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t round like
huckleberries and cramb&#8217;ries, but longish, and a little p&#8217;inted to
each end. And the stem it growed on, the little bit of a stem, you
know, comin&#8217; out o&#8217; the plant&#8217;s big stem, like a little neck to the
berry, was pinky and real pretty. And this berry didn&#8217;t have a lot o&#8217;
teenty little seeds inside on it, like most berries, but it jest had
one pretty white stone in it, with raised up streaks on it.</p>

<p>The plant set everything by her little berry. She thought there
never was in<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span> all the airth sech a beautiful berry as
hern,&mdash;so pretty shaped and so whitey blue, with sech a soft skin
and pinky neck, and more partic&#8217;lar with that nice, white, striped
stone inside of it. She held it all day and all night tight and fast.
When it rained real hard, and the wind blowed, she kind o&#8217; stretched
out some of her leaves, and covered her little berry up, and she done
the same when the sun was too hot. And the berry growed and growed,
and was so fat and smooth and pretty! And the plant was jest wropped
up in her little berry, lovin&#8217; it terr&#8217;ble hard, and bein&#8217; dreadful
proud on it, too.</p>

<p>Well, one day, real suddent, when the plant wasn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; of any
storm comin&#8217;, a little wind riz up. &#8217;T wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a gale, &#8217;t wa&#8217;n&#8217;t half
as hard a blow as the berry&#8217;d seen lots o&#8217; times and never got hurt
nor nothin&#8217;. And the plant wa&#8217;n&#8217;t<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span> lookin&#8217; out for any danger,
when all of a suddent there come a little bit of a snap, and the
slimsy little pink stem broke, and the little berry fell and rolled
away, and, &#8217;fore you could say &#8220;Jack Robinson,&#8221; &#8217;t was clean gone out
o&#8217; sight. I can&#8217;t begin to tell ye how that plant took on. Seem &#8217;s if
she&#8217;d die, or go ravin&#8217; crazy. It&#8217;s only folks that has lost jest what
they set most by on airth that can understand about it, I s&#8217;pose. She
wouldn&#8217;t b&#8217;leeve it fust off; she &#8217;most knowed she&#8217;d wake up and feel
her little berry a-holdin&#8217; close to her, hangin&#8217; on her, snugglin&#8217; up
to her under the shady leaves. The other plants &#8217;round there tried to
chirk her up and help her. One on &#8217;em told her how it had lost all its
little berries itself, a long spell back, and how it had some ways
stood it and got over it. &#8220;But they wa&#8217;n&#8217;t like mine,&#8221; thinks the poor
plant.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span> &#8220;There never, never was no berry like mine,
with its pretty figger, its pinky, slim little neck, and its soft,
smooth-feelin&#8217; skin.&#8221; And another plant told her mebbe her berry was
saved from growin&#8217; up a trouble to her, gettin&#8217; bad and hard, with
mebbe a worm inside on it, to make her ashamed and sorry. &#8220;Oh, no,
no!&#8221; thinks the mother plant. &#8220;My berry&#8217;d never got bad and hard, and
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; kep&#8217; any worm from touchin&#8217; its little white heart.&#8221; Not a
single thing the plant-folks said to her done a mite o&#8217; good. Their
talk only worried her and pestered her, when she jest wanted to be let
alone, so&#8217;s she could think about her little berry all to herself.</p>

<p>Just where the berry used to hang, and where the little pinky stem
broke off, there was a sore place, a sort o&#8217; scar, that ached and
smarted all day and<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span> all night, and never, never healed up. And
bimeby the poor plant got all wore out with the achin&#8217; and the
mournin&#8217; and the missin&#8217; and she &#8217;peared to feel her heart all a-dryin&#8217; up and stoppin&#8217;, and her leaves turned yeller and wrinkled,
and&mdash;she was dead. She couldn&#8217;t live on, ye see, without her
little berry.</p>

<p>They called it bein&#8217; dead, folks did, and it looked like it, for
there she lay without a sign of life for a long, long, long spell.
&#8217;Twas for days and weeks and months anyway. But it didn&#8217;t seem so long
to the mother plant. She shet up her eyes, feelin&#8217; powerful tired and
lonesome, and the next thing she knowed she opened &#8217;em again, and she
was wide awoke. She hardly knowed herself, though, she was so fresh
and juicy and &#8217;live, so kind o&#8217; young every way. Fust off she didn&#8217;t
think o&#8217; anything but that, how good and well she<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span> felt, and
how beautiful things was all &#8217;round her. Then all of a suddent she
rec&#8217;lected her little berry, and she says to herself, &#8220;Oh, dear, dear
me! If only my own little berry was here to see me now, and know how I
feel!&#8221; She thought she said it to herself, but mebbe she talked out
loud, for, jest as she said it, somebody answered her. &#8217;T was a Angel,
and he says, &#8220;Why your little berry does see you,&mdash;look there.&#8221;
And she looked, and she see he was p&#8217;intin&#8217; to the beautif&#8217;lest little
plant you never see,&mdash;straight and nice, with little bits o&#8217; soft
green leaves, with the sun a-shinin&#8217; through &#8217;em, and,&mdash;well,
somehow, you never can get it through your head how mothers take in
things,&mdash;she knowed cert&#8217;in sure that was her little berry.</p>

<p>The Angel begun to speak. He was goin&#8217; to explain how, if she
hadn&#8217;t never<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span> lost her berry, &#8217;twouldn&#8217;t never &#8217;a&#8217; growed
into this pretty plant, but, he see, all of a suddent, that he needn&#8217;t
take the trouble. She showed in her face she knowed all about
it,&mdash;every blessed thing. I tell ye, even angels ain&#8217;t much use
explainin&#8217; when there&#8217;s mothers, and it&#8217;s got to do with their own
child&#8217;en. Yes, the mother plant see it all, without tellin&#8217;. She was
jest a mite &#8217;shamed but she was terr&#8217;ble pleased.</p>

<h2>The Stony Head</h2><h3>V</h3>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>When little Lib told the story I give below,
Deacon Zenas Welcome was one of the listeners. The deacon was a son of
old Elder Welcome who had been many years before the pastor of the
little church in a neighboring village. Elder Welcome was one of the
old-fashioned sort not so common in these days, a good man, but stern
and somewhat harsh. He preached only the terrors of the law, dwelt
much upon the doctrines, the decrees, election, predestination, and
eternal punishment, and rarely lingered over such themes as the
fatherhood of God, his love to mankind, and his wonderful gift to a
lost world. The son followed in his father&#8217;s footsteps. He was a hard,
austere, melancholy<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span> man, undemonstrative and reticent, shutting
out all brightness from his own life, and clouding many an existence
going on around him. I have always thought that his unwonted presence
among us that day had a purpose, and that he had come to spy out some
taint of heterodoxy in Lib&#8217;s tales, to reprove and condemn. He went
away quietly, however, when the story was ended, and we heard nothing
of reproof or condemnation.</p>

<h3><a name='The_Stony_Head' id='The_Stony_Head'></a>The Stony
Head</h3>

<p>Once there was somethin&#8217; way up on the side of a mountain that
looked like a man&#8217;s head. The rocks up there&#8217;d got fixed so&#8217;s they
jest made a great big head and face, and everybody could see it as
plain as could be. Folks called it the Stony Head, and they come to
see it<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span> from miles away. There was a man lived
round there jest where he could see the head from his winder. He was a
man that things had gone wrong with all along; he&#8217;d had lots o&#8217;
trouble, and he didn&#8217;t take it very easy. He fretted and complained,
and blamed it on other folks, and more partic&#8217;lar on&mdash;God. And
one day&mdash;he&#8217;d jest come to live in them parts&mdash;he looked out
of his winder, and he see, standin&#8217; out plain ag&#8217;in the sky, he see
that Stony Head. It looked real ha&#8217;sh and hard and stony and dark, and
all of a suddent the man thought it was&mdash;God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he says to hisself, &#8220;that&#8217;s jest the way I &#8217;most knowed he
looked, ha&#8217;sh and hard and stony and dark, and that&#8217;s him.&#8221; The man
was dreadful scaret of it, but some ways he couldn&#8217;t stop lookin&#8217; at
it. And bimeby he shet hisself up there all alone, and spent his
whole<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span> time jest a-lookin&#8217; at that hard, stony
face, and thinkin&#8217; who&#8217;t was, and who&#8217;d brought all his trouble on
him. There was poor folks all &#8217;round that deestrict, but he never done
nothin&#8217; to help &#8217;em; let &#8217;em be hungry or thirsty or ailin&#8217;, or shet
up in jail, or anything, he never helped &#8217;em or done a thing for &#8217;em,
&#8217;cause he was a-lookin&#8217; every single minute at that head, and seein&#8217;
how stony and hard it was, and bein&#8217; scaret of it and the One he
thought it looked like.</p>

<p>Folks that was in trouble come along and knocked at his door, and
he never opened it a mite, even to see who was there. Sheep and lambs
that had got lost come a-strayin&#8217; into his yard, but he never took &#8217;em
in, nor showed &#8217;em the way home. He wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no good to nobody, not even
to hisself, for he was terr&#8217;ble unhappy and scaret and angry. So &#8217;t
went on, oh! I d&#8217;know how long,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span> years and years, I guess likely, and there
the man was shet up all alone, lookin&#8217; and lookin&#8217;, and scaret at
lookin&#8217; at that ha&#8217;sh, hard, stony face and head. But one day, as he
was settin&#8217; there by the winder lookin&#8217;, he heerd a little sound. I
d&#8217;know what made him hear it jest then. There&#8217;d been sech sounds as
that time and time ag&#8217;in, and he never took no notice. &#8217;Twas like a
child a-cryin&#8217;, and that&#8217;s common enough.</p>

<p>But this time it seemed diff&#8217;ent, and he couldn&#8217;t help takin&#8217;
notice. He tried not to hear it, but he had to. &#8217;T was a little child
a-cryin&#8217; as if it had lost its way and was scaret, and the man found
he couldn&#8217;t stand it somehow. Mebbe the reason was he&#8217;d had a little
boy of his own once, and he lost him. Now I think on &#8217;t, that was one
o&#8217; the things he blamed on God, and<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span> thought about when he looked
at the Stone Head. Anyway, he couldn&#8217;t stand this cryin&#8217; that time,
and he started up, and, fust thing he knowed, he&#8217;d opened the door and
gone out. He hadn&#8217;t been out in the sunshine and the air for a long
spell, and it made his head swimmy at fust. But he heerd the little
cryin&#8217; ag&#8217;in, and he run along on to find the child. But he couldn&#8217;t
find it; every time he&#8217;d think he was close to it, he&#8217;d hear the
cryin&#8217; a little further off. And he&#8217;d go on and on, a-stumblin&#8217; over
stones and fallin&#8217; over logs and a-steppin&#8217; into holes, but stickin&#8217;
to it, and forgettin&#8217; everything only that little cryin&#8217; voice ahead
of him. Seems &#8217;s if he jest must find that little lost boy or girl, &#8217;s
if he&#8217;d be more &#8217;n willin&#8217; to give up his own poor lonesome old life to
save that child. And, jest &#8217;s he come to thinkin&#8217; that, he see
somethin&#8217; ahead<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span> of him movin&#8217; and in a minute he knowed
he&#8217;d found the lost child.</p>

<p>&#8217;Fore he thought what he was a-doin&#8217;, he got down on his knees
jest&#8217;s he used to do &#8217;fore he got angry at God, and was goin&#8217; to thank
him for helpin&#8217; him to save that child. Then he rec&#8217;lected. It come
back to him who God was, and how he&#8217;d seed his head, with the ha&#8217;sh
stony face up on the mountain, and that made him look up to see it
ag&#8217;in.</p>

<p>And oh! what do you think he see? There was the same head up
there,&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t make a mistake about that,&mdash;but the
face, oh! the face was so diff&#8217;ent. It wasn&#8217;t ha&#8217;sh nor hard nor dark
any more. There was such a lovin&#8217;, beautiful, kind sort o&#8217; look on it
now. Some ways it made the man think a mite of the way his father,
that had died ever so long ago, used to look at him when he was a boy,
and had been bad, and<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span> then was sorry and &#8217;shamed. Oh, &#8217;t was the
beautif&#8217;lest face you never see! &#8220;Oh! what ever does it mean?&#8221; says
the man out loud. &#8220;What&#8217;s changed that face so? Oh! what in the
world&#8217;s made it so diff&#8217;ent?&#8221; And jest that minute a Angel come up
close to him. &#8217;T was a little young Angel, and I guess mebbe &#8217;t was
what he&#8217;d took for a lost child, and that he&#8217;d been follerin&#8217; so fur.
And the Angel says, &#8220;The face ain&#8217;t changed a mite. &#8217;Twas jest like
that all the time, only you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; at it from a diff&#8217;ent p&#8217;int.&#8221;
And &#8217;twas so, and he see it right off. He&#8217;d been follerin&#8217; that cryin&#8217;
so fur and so long that he&#8217;d got into a diff&#8217;ent section o&#8217; country,
and he&#8217;d got a diff&#8217;ent view, oh! a terr&#8217;ble diff&#8217;ent view, and he
never went back.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>Everybody in Greenhills knew &#8220;Stoopin&#8217;
Jacob,&#8221; the little humpbacked boy who lived at the north end of the
village. From babyhood he had suffered from a grievous deformity which
rounded his little shoulders and bowed the frail form. It was
characteristic of the kindly folk of the neighborhood, that, instead
of calling the boy Hump-backed or Crooked-backed Jacob, they gave him
the name of Stoopin&#8217; Jacob, as if the bowed and bent posture was
voluntary, and not enforced.</p>

<p>A lovely soul dwelt in that crooked, pain-racked body, and looked
out of the gentle brown eyes shining in the pale, thin little face.
Every one loved the boy, most of all the dogs, cats,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span> horses,
cows of the little farms, the birds and animals of forest and
brookside. He knew them all, and they knew, loved, and trusted him.
The tinier creatures, such as butterflies, bees, ants, beetles, even
caterpillars, downy or smooth, were his friends, or seemed so. He knew
them, watched them, studied their habits, and was the little
naturalist of Greenhills village, consulted by all, even by older and
wiser people.</p>

<p>A close friendship existed between the boy and Story-tell Lib, and
we all understood the tale she told us one day when Stoopin&#8217; Jacob was
one of the listeners.</p>

<h3><a name='Diffent_Kind_o_Bundles'
id='Diffent_Kind_o_Bundles'></a>Diff&#8217;ent Kind o&#8217; Bundles</h3>

<p>Once there was a lot o&#8217; folks, and every single one on &#8217;em had
bundles on their backs. But they was all diff&#8217;ent,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span> oh! jest
as diff&#8217;ent as&mdash;as anything, the bundles was. And these folks all
b&#8217;longed to one person, that they called the Head Man. They was his
folks, and nobody else&#8217;s, and he had the whole say, and could do
anything he wanted to. But he was real nice, and always done jest the
best thing,&mdash;yes, sir, the bestest thing, whatever folks might
say against it.</p>

<p>Well, I was tellin&#8217; ye about how these folks had diff&#8217;ent kind o&#8217;
bundles on their backs. &#8217;Twas this way. One on &#8217;em was a man that had
a real hefty bundle on his back, that he&#8217;d put on there
hisself,&mdash;not all to onct, but a mite to time, for years &#8216;n&#8217;
years. &#8217;Twas a real cur&#8217;us bundle, made up out o&#8217; little things in the
road that&#8217;d got in his way, or hurt him, or put him back. Some on &#8217;em
was jest little stones that had hurt his feet, and some was
little<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span> stingin&#8217; weeds that smarted him as he went
by &#8217;em, and some was jest mites o&#8217; dirt somebody&#8217;d throwed at him, not
meanin&#8217; no great o&#8217; harm. He&#8217;d picked &#8217;em all up, every bit o&#8217;
worryin&#8217;, prickin&#8217;, hurtin&#8217; little thing, and he&#8217;d piled &#8217;em up on his
back till he had a big bundle that he allers carried about and never
forgot for a minute.</p>

<p>He was f&#8217;rever lookin&#8217; out for sech troublin&#8217; things, too, and he&#8217;d
see &#8217;em way ahead on him in his road, and sometimes he&#8217;d think he see
&#8217;em when there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any there &#8217;t all. And, &#8217;stead o&#8217; lettin&#8217; &#8217;em lay
where they was, and goin&#8217; right ahead and forgettin&#8217; &#8217;em, he&#8217;d pick
every single one on &#8217;em up and pile &#8217;em on that bundle, and carry &#8217;em
wherever he went.</p>

<p>And he was allers talkin&#8217; about &#8217;em to folks, p&#8217;intin&#8217; out that
little stone that he&#8217;d stubbed his toe on, and this pesky<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span> weed that
stung him, and t&#8217;other little mite o&#8217; mud he&#8217;d conceited somebody&#8217;d
throwed at him. He fretted and scolded and complained &#8217;bout &#8217;em, and
made out that nobody never had so many tryin&#8217; things gettin&#8217; in his
way as he had. He never took into &#8217;count, ye see, that he&#8217;d picked &#8217;em
up hisself and piled &#8217;em on his own back. If he&#8217;d jest let &#8217;em lay,
and gone along, he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; forgot &#8217;em all, I guess, after a spell.</p>

<p>Then there was another man with a bundle, a cur&#8217;us one too, for &#8217;t
was all made out o&#8217; money, dreadful heavy and cold and hard to carry.
Every speck o&#8217; money he could scrape together he&#8217;d put in that bundle,
till he couldn&#8217;t scursely heft it, &#8217;twas that big and weighed so much.
He had plenty o&#8217; chances to make it lighter, for there was folks all
along the road that needed it bad,&mdash;little child&#8217;en that hadn&#8217;t
no<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
clo&#8217;es nor no victuals, and sick folks and old folks, every one on &#8217;em
needin&#8217; money dreadful bad. But the man never gin &#8217;em a mite. He kep&#8217;
it all on his back, a-hurtin&#8217; and weighin&#8217; him down.</p>

<p>Then ag&#8217;in there was another man. He had a bundle that he didn&#8217;t
put on his back hisself, nor the Head Man didn&#8217;t nuther. Folks did it
to him. He hadn&#8217;t done nothin&#8217; to deserve it, &#8217;t was jest put on him
by other people, and so &#8217;t was powerful hard to bear. But, ye see, the
Head Man had pervided partic&#8217;lar for them kind, and he&#8217;d said in
public, so &#8217;t everybody knowed about it, that he&#8217;d help folks like
that,&mdash;said he&#8217;d help &#8217;em carry sech bundles hisself, or mebbe
take &#8217;em off, if it &#8217;peared to be best.</p>

<p>But this man disremembered that,&mdash;or, worse still, p&#8216;r&#8217;aps he
didn&#8217;t &#8217;zackly<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span> believe it. So he went along all scrunched
down with that hefty bundle other folks had piled up on him, not
scoldin&#8217; nor complainin&#8217; nor gittin&#8217; mad about it, but jest thinkin&#8217;
it had got to be, and nobody could help him. But ye see it hadn&#8217;t got
to be, and somebody could &#8217;a&#8217; helped him.</p>

<p>And then bimeby along come a man that had sech a hefty, hefty
bundle! &#8217;Twas right &#8217;tween his shoulders, and it sort o&#8217; scrooched him
down, and it hurt him in his back and in his feelin&#8217;s. The Head Man
had put that bundle on the man hisself when he was a little bit of a
feller. He&#8217;d made it out o&#8217; flesh and skin and things. It was jest
ezackly like the man&#8217;s body, so &#8217;t when it ached he ached hisself. And
he&#8217;d had to carry that thing about all his born days.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why the Head Man done<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span> it, I&#8217;m sure, but I know how
good and pleasant he was, and how he liked his folks and meant well to
&#8217;em, and how he knowed jest what oughter be and what hadn&#8217;t oughter
be, so &#8217;t stands to reason he&#8217;d done this thing a-purpose, and not
careless like, and he hadn&#8217;t made no mistake.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve guessed a lot o&#8217; reasons why he done it. Mebbe he see the man
wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; done so well without the bundle,&mdash;might &#8217;a&#8217; run off,
&#8217;way, &#8217;way off from the Head Man and the work he had to do. Or, ag&#8217;in,
p&#8216;r&#8217;aps he wanted to make a &#8217;zample of the man, and show folks how
patient and nice a body could be, even though he had a big, hefty
bundle to carry all his born days, one made out o&#8217; flesh and skin and
things, and that hurt dreadful.</p>

<p>But my other guess is the one I b&#8217;leeve in most,&mdash;that the
Head Man done it<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span> to scrooch him down, so&#8217;s he&#8217;d take notice
o&#8217; little teenty things, down below, that most folks never see, things
that needed him to watch &#8217;em, and do for &#8217;em, and tell about &#8217;em.
That&#8217;s my fav&#8217;rite guess. &#8217;Tany rate, the Head Man done
right,&mdash;I&#8217;m cert&#8217;in sure o&#8217; that.</p>

<p>And it <i>had</i> made the man nicer, and pleasanter spoken, and
kinder to folks, and partic&#8217;lar to creaturs. It had made him sort o&#8217;
bend down, &#8217;twas so hefty, and so he&#8217;d got to takin&#8217; notice o&#8217; teenty
little things nobody else scursely&#8217;d see,&mdash;mites o&#8217; posies, and
cunnin&#8217; little bugs, and creepin&#8217;, crawlin&#8217; things. He took a heap o&#8217;
comfort in &#8217;em. And he told other folks &#8217;bout them little things and
their little ways, and what they was made for, and things they could
learn us; and &#8217;twas real int&#8217;restin&#8217;, and done folks good too.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span></p>

<p>And, deary me, he was that patient and good and uncomplainin&#8217;, you
never see! No, I ain&#8217;t a-cryin&#8217;. This was a stranger, this man, you
know, and I make a p&#8217;int o&#8217; never cryin&#8217; about strangers.</p>

<p>There was a lot and a lot more kinds o&#8217; folks with bundles, but I&#8217;m
only goin&#8217; to tell ye about them four,&mdash;this time, any way.</p>

<p>Well, come pay day, these folks all come up afore the Head Man to
be settled with. And fust he called up the man that had the bundle all
made out o&#8217; things that had pricked him, and tripped him up, and
scratched him, and put him back on the road. And then he had up the
man with the money weighin&#8217; him down,&mdash;the money he&#8217;d kep&#8217; away
from poor folks and piled up on his own back. And then come the feller
that was carryin&#8217; the heavy bundle<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span> folks had put on him when &#8217;t
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no fault o&#8217; his&#8217;n, and that he might &#8217;a&#8217; got red of a long
spell back, if he&#8217;d only rec&#8217;lected what the Head Man had said &#8217;bout
sech cases, and how they could be helped.</p>

<p>I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to tell ye what he said to them folks, &#8217;cause &#8217;t
ain&#8217;t my business, seems to me. Whether he punished either on &#8217;em, or
scolded &#8217;em, or sent &#8217;em off to try ag&#8217;in, or what all, never mind.
Knowin&#8217; &#8217;s much as I do about the ways o&#8217; that Head Man, I bet he made
&#8217;em feel terrible ashamed, any way.</p>

<p>But when he came to the man with the bundle made out o&#8217; flesh and
skin and things, he looks at him a minute, and then says he, the Head
Man does, &#8220;Why,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that&#8217;s my own work! I made that bundle, and
I fixed it on your back all myself. I hefted and I<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span> sized it,
and I hefted you and sized you. A mite of a young one you was then. I
made it jest hefty enough for you to carry, not a bit heftier, no more
nor less. I rec&#8217;lect it well,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t forgot it. I never
forgot it one minute sence I fitted in on, though mebbe you kind o&#8217;
thought by spells that I had. And now,&#8221; he says&mdash;No, I can&#8217;t tell
ye what he says. It&#8217;s a secret, that is. But I don&#8217;t mind lettin&#8217; ye
know that the man was sat&#8217;sfied, perfec&#8217;ly sat&#8217;sfied. A Angel told me
he was, and went on to say the man was dreadful pleased to find he&#8217;d
been wearin&#8217; a bundle the Head Man hisself had made and fixed on him,
heftin&#8217; it and sizin&#8217; it, and heftin&#8217; him and sizin&#8217; him too, so&#8217;s
&#8216;twa&#8217;n&#8217;t too much for him to carry. But he ain&#8217;t carryin&#8217; it no more.
The Angel said so.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>I
Have told you that little Lib was a delicate child, and that she grew
more and more fragile and weak as the summer went on. In the hot, dry
days of August she drooped like a thirsty flower, and her strength
failed very fast. Her voice, though still sweet and clear, lost its
shrillness, and one had to draw very close to the little speaker that
he might not lose a word of the stories she told. Aunt Jane York often
came out to us now, anxious and fussy, talking fretfully of and to
little Lib, feeling the small hands and feet to see if they were cold,
and drawing the shawl closer around the wasted form. I know she loved
the little girl, and perhaps she wished now that she had shown
that<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
love more tenderly. She talked freely, in the very presence of the
child, of her rapid decline and the probability that she would not
&#8220;last long.&#8221; Lib said nothing concerning her own condition, and showed
no sign of having heard her aunt&#8217;s comments. But one day, when Miss
York, after speaking very freely and plainly of the child&#8217;s
approaching end, had gone indoors, Lib announced, in a low, sweet
voice, a new story.</p>

<h3><a name='The_Boy_that_was_Scaret'
id='The_Boy_that_was_Scaret'></a>The Boy that was Scaret o&#8217; Dyin&#8217;</h3>

<p>Once there was a boy that was dreadful scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217;. Some folks
is that way, you know; they ain&#8217;t never done it to know how it feels,
and they&#8217;re scaret. And this boy was that way. He wa&#8217;n&#8217;t very rugged,
his health was sort o&#8217; slim, and mebbe that made him<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span> think
about sech things more. &#8217;Tany rate, he was terr&#8217;ble scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217;.
&#8217;Twas a long time ago this was,&mdash;the times when posies and
creaturs could talk so&#8217;s folks could know what they was sayin&#8217;.</p>

<p>And one day, as this boy, his name was Reuben,&mdash;I forget his
other name,&mdash;as Reuben was settin&#8217; under a tree, an ellum tree,
cryin&#8217;, he heerd a little, little bit of a voice,&mdash;not squeaky,
you know, but small and thin and soft like,&mdash;and he see &#8217;twas a
posy talkin&#8217;. &#8217;Twas one o&#8217; them posies they call Benjamins, with
three-cornered whitey blowths with a mite o&#8217; pink on &#8217;em, and it
talked in a kind o&#8217; pinky-white voice, and it says, &#8220;What you cryin&#8217;
for, Reuben?&#8221; And he says, &#8220;&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217;,&#8221; says he; &#8220;I&#8217;m
dreadful scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217;.&#8221; Well, what do you think? That posy jest
laughed,&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span> most cur&#8217;us little pinky-white laugh &#8217;t
was,&mdash;and it says, the Benjamin says: &#8220;Dyin&#8217;! Scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217;?
Why, I die myself every single year o&#8217; my life.&#8221; &#8220;Die yourself!&#8221; says
Reuben. &#8220;You &#8217;re foolin&#8217;; you&#8217;re alive this minute.&#8221; &#8220;&#8217;Course I be,&#8221;
says the Benjamin; &#8220;but that&#8217;s neither here nor there,&mdash;I&#8217;ve died
every year sence I can remember.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t it hurt?&#8221; says the boy. &#8220;No,
it don&#8217;t,&#8221; says the posy; &#8220;it&#8217;s real nice. You see, you get kind o&#8217;
tired a-holdin&#8217; up your head straight and lookin&#8217; peart and wide
awake, and tired o&#8217; the sun shinin&#8217; so hot, and the winds blowin&#8217; you
to pieces, and the bees a-takin&#8217; your honey. So it&#8217;s nice to feel
sleepy and kind o&#8217; hang your head down, and get sleepier and sleepier,
and then find you&#8217;re droppin&#8217; off. Then you wake up jest &#8217;t the nicest
time o&#8217; year, and come up and look &#8217;round, and&mdash;why, I<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span> like to
die, I do.&#8221; But someways that didn&#8217;t help Reuben much as you&#8217;d think.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a posy,&#8221; he think to himself, &#8220;and mebbe I wouldn&#8217;t come
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, another time he was settin&#8217; on a stone in the lower pastur&#8217;,
cryin&#8217; again, and he heerd another cur&#8217;us little voice. &#8217;t wa&#8217;n&#8217;t like
the posy&#8217;s voice, but &#8217;twas a little, wooly, soft, fuzzy voice, and he
see &#8217;t was a caterpillar a-talkin&#8217; to him. And the caterpillar says,
in his fuzzy little voice, he says, &#8220;What you cryin&#8217; for, Reuben?&#8221; And
the boy, he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m powerful scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217;, that&#8217;s why,&#8221; he says.
And that fuzzy caterpillar he laughed. &#8220;Dyin&#8217;!&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m lottin&#8217;
on dyin&#8217; myself. All my fam&#8217;ly,&#8221; he says, &#8220;die every once in a while,
and when they wake up they&#8217;re jest splendid,&mdash;got wings, and fly
about, and live on honey and things.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span> Why, I wouldn&#8217;t miss it for
anything!&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m lottin&#8217; on it.&#8221; But somehow that didn&#8217;t chirk
up Reuben much. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t a caterpillar,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and mebbe I
wouldn&#8217;t wake up at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, there was lots o&#8217; other things talked to that boy, and tried
to help him,&mdash;trees and posies and grass and crawlin&#8217; things,
that was allers a-dyin&#8217; and livin&#8217;, and livin&#8217; and dyin&#8217;. Reuben
thought it didn&#8217;t help him any, but I guess it did a little mite, for
he couldn&#8217;t help thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; what they every one on &#8217;em said. But he
was scaret all the same.</p>

<p>And one summer he begun to fail up faster and faster, and he got so
tired he couldn&#8217;t hardly hold his head up, but he was scaret all the
same. And one day he was layin&#8217; on the bed, and lookin&#8217; out o&#8217; the
east winder, and the sun kep&#8217; a-shinin&#8217; in his eyes till he shet &#8217;em
up,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
and he fell asleep. He had a real good nap, and when he woke up he
went out to take a walk.</p>

<p>And he begun to think o&#8217; what the posies and trees and creaturs had
said about dyin&#8217;, and how they laughed at his bein&#8217; scaret at it, and
he says to himself, &#8220;Why, someways I don&#8217;t feel so scaret to-day, but
I s&#8217;pose I be.&#8221; And jest then what do you think he done? Why, he met a
Angel. He&#8217;d never seed one afore, but he knowed it right off. And the
Angel says, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you happy, little boy?&#8221; And Reuben says, &#8220;Well, I
would be, only I&#8217;m so dreadful scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217;. It must be terr&#8217;ble
cur&#8217;us,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to be dead.&#8221; And the Angel says, &#8220;Why, you be
dead.&#8221; And he was.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The story of the boy that was scaret o&#8217; dyin&#8217; was the last story
that little Lib<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span> ever told us. We saw her sometimes after
that, but she was not strong enough to talk much. She sat no longer
now in the low chair under the maples, but lay on a chintz-covered
couch in the sitting-room, by the west windows. The once shrilly-sweet
voice with its clear bird tones was but a whisper now, as she told us
over and again, while she lay there, that she would tell us a new
story &#8220;to-morrow.&#8221; It was always &#8220;to-morrow&#8221; till the end came. And
the story was to be, so the whisper went on, &#8220;the beautif&#8217;lest
story,&mdash;oh, you never did!&#8221; And its name was to be,&mdash;what a
faint and feeble reproduction of the old triumphant announcement of a
new title!&mdash;&#8220;The Posy Gardin&#8217; that the King Kep&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>She never told us that story. Before the autumn leaves had fallen,
while the maples in front of the farmhouse were<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span> still red
and glorious in their dying beauty, we laid our little friend to rest.
Perhaps she will tell us the tale some day. I am sure there will be &#8220;a
Angel&#8221; in it,&mdash;sure, too, that the story will have a new and
tender meaning if we hear it there, that story of the King and of the
posy gardin&#8217; he kep&#8217;.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
